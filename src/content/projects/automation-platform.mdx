{/* <!-- Introduction --> */}
The **Identity Services Automation Platform** was built to digitize and streamline workflows between service counters and civil registry offices. Developed with **ASP.NET MVC**, **Entity Framework**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**, it replaces manual, paperâ€‘based procedures with secure, transparent, and traceable digital processes.
Service counters submit identity document requestsâ€”such as certificate changesâ€”and track each request through its full lifecycle, with roleâ€‘based access control, timeâ€‘stamped status updates, and automated notifications. The platform increases accountability, reduces processing time, and gives all stakeholders clear visibility into request progress.
